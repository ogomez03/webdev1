        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>The Union of Ladder's story begins in the late summer of 1998 starting with our founder, Gustavo Freeman. Gustavo was a passionate man who believes that ladders is the peak of human technology. Ladders may seemed to be a simplistic tool only used to reach higher places, but Gustavo knew that there was more to ladders than meet the eye. Ladders, in Gustavo's eyes, helped people reach places they never could in their life, whether it be the roof of their house or the ceiling. Gustavo, on a quest to sought out like-minded individuals, founded the Union of Ladders not only to unite ladders lovers all over the world but also to help spread the love of ladders to other people.
        <br>
        Even though the Union of Ladders didn't start off as strong as Gustavo might have wished, he still managed to keep the Union alive despite the criticism and harassments of the ladder haters. This perseverance was later paid off as more and more support came in from every corner of the globe. Eventually the Union of Ladders would gain recognition through the internet and news outlets. As time passes on, this newfound recognition ended up helping the Union of Ladders land a deal with one of the top sellers in ladders. Now they are no longer just a group of ladder-lovers but also a source to buy ladders. 
        <br>    
        In the last couple of years, 100% of the money from donations and ladder profits are donated to ladder research, to ladder production, and to various charities around the world. This is in respect to our founder's original message of supporting ladder lovers around the world. As the days continue to pass by, Gustavo Freeman continues to set out his original goal: to help unite people with the passion for ladders.</p>
